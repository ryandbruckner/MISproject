            <h2 class="hobby-title">Canadian Wilderness Fishing</h2>
            <p class="hobby-description">One of my most memorable experiences was a fly-in fishing trip in Canada. Living in a cabin on an isolated island, we had the perfect opportunity to immerse ourselves in nature and enjoy incredible fishing. Catching an average of 20 fish a day, the experience was nothing short of spectacular. The solitude and beauty of the Canadian wilderness made this adventure truly unforgettable.</p>

            <h2 class="hobby-title">Outdoor Work & Nature</h2>
            <p class="hobby-description">My passion for the outdoors extends to my work life. I spent my summer working on a golf course grounds crew, starting each day at 6 AM and working until 2 PM. This experience allowed me to combine my love for nature with meaningful work. Maintaining the course's beauty and ensuring perfect playing conditions was both challenging and rewarding. The early morning starts offered peaceful moments and beautiful sunrises, making every day unique.</p>
